### Here is an example of how to cherry-pick a commit:
1. Make sure you are on the branch where you wants to add a new commit.(where you wants to add a new commit)
`git switch main_branch`
2. Use git log to find the commit hash of the commit:

`git log`

or

`git log --oneline`  //for get 7 digits hash commit

or

//see commits to a specific branch(which branch commit you want to copy)
`git log --oneline feature_branch`
Copy the hash commit thats you want to cherry-pick

3. Execute the following command:


`git cherry-pick <commit-hash>`

or

`git cherry-pick feature_branch~2`

### How to cherry-pick multiple commits:
If you want to pick all the commits from commit A to c(where A is older than c) run:

`git log --oneline`  //get 7 digits hash commit

`git cherry-pick A^..C ` //pick all the commits from A to C (including A)
If you need to exclude the first commit (Commit A in our case)

//If you want to ignore A itself
`git cherry-pick A..C`  //pick all the commits from B to C (exclude A)
