## Git Repository Update

### Question :  
The Nautilus development team started with new project development. They have created different search Git repositories to manage respective project's source code. One of the repo /opt/cluster.git was created recently. The team has given us a sample index.html file that is currently present on jump host under /tmp. The repository has been cloned at /usr/src/kodekloudrepos on storage server in Stratos DC.

Copy sample index.html file from jump host to storage server under cloned repository at /usr/src/kodekloudrepos, add/commit the file and push to master branch.

### Solution:   

1.  At 1st SCP index.html file from jump server to the storage server    

`sudo scp /tmp/index.html  natasha@ststor01:/tmp`

2. login on storage server  & switch to root user
```
sshpass -p Bl@kW ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no natasha@ststor01

sudo su -
```

3. Go to project repositories as per the task     


`cd   /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/cluster/`

`ll`

4. Copy html file from tmp to repo 
       
`cp /tmp/index.html  .`

`ll`

5.  Add and commit the index.html file  

`git add index.html`

`git commit -m "add index.html"`

6. Finally push master branch to the origin.

`git push -u origin master`
