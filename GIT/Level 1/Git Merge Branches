## Git Merge Branches

Question : The Nautilus application development team has been working on a project repository /opt/official.git. This repo is cloned at /usr/src/kodekloudrepos on storage server in Stratos DC. They recently shared the following requirements with DevOps team:

a. Create a new branch devops in /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/official repo from master and copy the /tmp/index.html file (on storage server itself). Add/commit this file in the new branch and merge back that branch to the master branch. Finally, push the changes to origin for both of the branches.

Solution:  
1. At first login on to the storage server  & switch to the root user

```
sshpass -p Bl@kW ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no natasha@ststor01

sudo su -
```

2. Check repo  git status 


`ll /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/official/`

`git status`


3. Create a new branch as per the task from the master repo

`git checkout -b devops`

`git status`

4. Check  new branch status  & copy the index file 

`git branch`

* devops

  master



`cp /tmp/index.html  /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/official/`

`ll /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/official/`

5. Git add , Commit Index.html file 

`git add index.html`

`git commit -m "add official"`

6. Git Checkout master & merge to new branch

`git checkout master`

`git merge devops`

7. Git push to the branch as well master 


`git push -u origin devops`


`git push -u origin master`

`git status`
