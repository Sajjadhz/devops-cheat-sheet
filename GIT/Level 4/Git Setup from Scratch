## Git Setup from Scratch

### Question :  
Some new developers have joined xFusionCorp Industries and have been assigned Nautilus project. They are going to start development on a new application, and some pre-requisites have been shared with the DevOps team to proceed with. Please note that all tasks need to be performed on storage server in Stratos DC.

a. Install git, set up any values for user.email and user.name globally and create a bare repository /opt/apps.git.

b. There is an update hook (to block direct pushes to master branch) under /tmp on storage server itself; use the same to block direct pushes to master branch in /opt/apps.git repo.

c. Clone /opt/apps.git repo in /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/apps directory.

d. Create a new branch xfusioncorp_apps in repo that you cloned in /usr/src/kodekloudrepos.

e. There is a readme.md file in /tmp on storage server itself; copy that to repo, add/commit in the new branch you created, and finally push your branch to origin.

f. Also create master branch from your branch and remember you should not be able to push to master as per hook you have set up.

### Solution:  
1. At first login on to the storage server & Switch to the root user 

2. Install Git package 


`yum install -y git`

3. Setup git config for the user.email and user.name globally    

`git config --global --add user.name natasha`

`git config --global --add user.email natasha@stratos.xfusioncorp.com`

4. Create a bare repository

`git init --bare /opt/apps.git`

5. Copy the /tmp/update hook to hooks directory under /opt/apps.git
    
`cp /tmp/update  /opt/apps.git/hooks/`

6. clone git repository under /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/  directory.


`cd /usr/src/kodekloudrepos/`

`git clone  /opt/apps.git`

`cd apps`

8. Create a new branch as per the task  in the repo that you cloned 

`git checkout -b xfusioncorp_apps`

9. There is a readme.md file in /tmp , copy that to repo, add/commit in the new branch and finally push your branch to origin.  ( Refer Below Video for more clarity ) 

`cp /tmp/readme.md .`

`ll`

`git add readme.md`

`git commit -m "Readme file"`

`git push origin xfusioncorp_apps`

10. To validate the task switch to  master branch and attempt a push to origin . 

        You should get an error hook declined     

`git checkout -b master`

`git branch`

`git push origin master`
