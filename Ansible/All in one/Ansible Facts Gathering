## Ansible Facts Gathering

### Question: The Nautilus DevOps team is trying to setup a simple Apache web server on all app servers in Stratos DC using Ansible. They also want to create a sample html page for now with some app specific data on it. Below you can find more details about the task.

You will find a valid inventory file /home/thor/playbooks/inventory on jump host (which we are using as an Ansible controller).

Create a playbook index.yml under /home/thor/playbooks directory on jump host. Using blockinfile Ansible module create a file facts.txt under /root directory on all app servers and add the following given block in it. You will need to enable fact gathering for this task.

Ansible managed node IP is <default ipv4 address>

(You can obtain default ipv4 address from Ansible's gathered facts by using correct the Ansible variable taking into account Jinja2 syntax)

Install httpd server on all apps. After that make a copy of facts.txt file as index.html under /var/www/html. Make sure to start httpd service after that.


Note: Do not create a separate role for this task, just add all changes in index.yml playbook.

### Solution:  
1. Go through the folder mentioned in task and create inventory & playbook files

     `cd /home/thor/playbooks/`


2. Create a playbook file as per the task 
```
---

-

  hosts: stapp01, stapp02, stapp03

  gather_facts: true

  become: yes

  become_method: sudo

  tasks:

    - name: create a  file using blockinfile

      blockinfile:

       create: yes

       path: /root/facts.txt

       block: |

         Ansible managed node IP is {{ ansible_default_ipv4.address }}

    - name: Install apache packages

      package:

       name: httpd

    - name: file copy

      shell: cp /root/facts.txt /var/www/html/index.html

    - name: ensure httpd is running

      systemd:

       name: httpd

       state: restarted
```
3. Post file saved , run below command to execute the playbook

   `ansible-playbook  -i inventory index.yml`

4. validate the task by curl to all app server and check
      `curl http://stapp01`
