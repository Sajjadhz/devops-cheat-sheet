## Creating Soft Links Using Ansible

### Question : 
Create a playbook.yml under /home/thor/ansible on jump host; an inventory file is already present under /home/thor/ansible directory on jump host itself.

Create an empty file /opt/itadmin/blog.txt on app server 1; its user owner and group owner should be tony. Create a symbolic link of source path /opt/itadmin to destination /var/www/html.

Create an empty file /opt/itadmin/story.txt on app server 2; its user owner and group owner should be steve. Create a symbolic link of source path /opt/itadmin to destination /var/www/html.

Create an empty file /opt/itadmin/media.txt on app server 3; its user owner and group owner should be banner. Create a symbolic link of source path /opt/itadmin to destination /var/www/html.

Note: Validation will try to run playbook using command ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml so please make sure playbook works this way, without passing any extra arguments.

### Solution:  
1. At first ansible inventory file is working properly and doesn't have any file exist from jump server to all the app server's

      `ansible all -a "ls -ltr /opt/itadmin" -i inventory`

2.  If you see above output then create playbook file 

       `vi /home/thor/ansible/playbook.yml` 
```
- name: Create text files and create soft link

  hosts: stapp01, stapp02, stapp03

  become: yes

  tasks:

    - name: Create the blog.txt on stapp01

      file:

        path: /opt/itadmin/blog.txt

        owner: tony

        group: tony

        state: touch

      when: inventory_hostname == "stapp01"

    - name: Create the story.txt on stapp02

      file:

        path: /opt/itadmin/story.txt

        owner: steve

        group: steve

        state: touch

      when: inventory_hostname == "stapp02"

    - name: Create the media.txt on stapp03

      file:

        path: /opt/itadmin/media.txt

        owner: banner

        group: banner

        state: touch

      when: inventory_hostname == "stapp03"

    - name: Link /opt/itadmin directory

      file:

        src: /opt/itadmin/

        dest: /var/www/html

        state: link
```

  3.  Post file saved , run below command to execute the playbook

        `ansible-playbook  -i inventory playbook.yml`

4.  Validate the task by below command 

      `ansible all -a "ls -ltr /opt/itadmin" -i inventory`
