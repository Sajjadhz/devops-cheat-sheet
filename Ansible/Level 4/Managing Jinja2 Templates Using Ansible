## Managing Jinja2 Templates Using Ansible

### Question : 
One of the Nautilus DevOps team members is working to develop a role for httpd installation and configuration. Work is almost completed, however there is a requirement to add a jinja2 template for index.html file. Additionally, the relevant task needs to be added inside the role. The inventory file ~/ansible/inventory is already present on jump host that can be used. Complete the task as per details mentioned below:

a. Update ~/ansible/playbook.yml playbook to run the httpd role on App Server 2.

b. Create a jinja2 template index.html.j2 under /home/thor/ansible/role/httpd/templates/ and add a line This file was created using Ansible on <respective server> (for example This file was created using Ansible on stapp01 in case of App Server 1). Also please make sure not to hard code the server name inside the template. Instead, use inventory_hostname variable to fetch the correct value.

c. Add a task inside /home/thor/ansible/role/httpd/tasks/main.yml to copy this template on App Server 2 in /var/www/html/index.html. Also make sure that /var/www/html/index.html file permissions 0644.

d. The user/group owner of /var/www/html/index.html file must be respective sudo user of server (for example tony in case of stapp01).

### Solution:  
1. Go through the folder mentioned in task and verified the playbook     

`cd  ~/ansible/`
`ll`

2.  Edit the exiting file /home/thor/ansible/playbook.yml and add the required host
`cat playbook.yml`
```
---

- hosts:

  become: yes

  become_user: root

  roles:

    - role/httpd
```
`vi playbook.yml`

`cat playbook.yml`
```
---

- hosts: stapp02

  become: yes

  become_user: root

  roles:

    - role/httpd
```
    
3.  Create a Jinja2 template file with the below content

`vi /home/thor/ansible/role/httpd/templates/index.html.j2`

`cat  /home/thor/ansible/role/httpd/templates/index.html.j2`

This file was created using Ansible on {{ ansible_hostname }}

4.  Edit the file to add a task to copy the Jinja2 template 

`vi /home/thor/ansible/role/httpd/tasks/main.yml`

`cat  /home/thor/ansible/role/httpd/tasks/main.yml`
```
---

#task file for role/test

- name: install the latest version of httpd

  yum:

    name: httpd

    state: latest

- name: Start service httpd

  service:

    name: httpd

    state: started

- name: Use Jinja2 template to generate index.html

  template:

    src: /home/thor/ansible/role/httpd/templates/index.html.j2

    dest: /var/www/html/index.html

    mode: "0644"

    owner: "{{ ansible_user }}"

    group: "{{ ansible_user }}"
```
 
5.  Post file saved , run below command to execute the playbook 

`ansible-playbook  -i inventory playbook.yml`

6. Validate the task by running the below command     

`ansible stapp02 -a "cat /var/www/html/index.html" -i inventory`
