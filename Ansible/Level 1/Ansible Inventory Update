## Ansible Inventory Update

### Question: 
The Nautilus DevOps team has started testing their Ansible playbooks on different servers within the stack. They have placed some playbooks under /home/thor/playbook/ directory on jump host which they want to test. Some of these playbooks have already been tested on different servers, but now they want to test them on app server 2 in Stratos DC. However, they first need to create an inventory file so that Ansible can connect to the respective app. Below are some requirements:

a. Create an ini type Ansible inventory file /home/thor/playbook/inventory on jump host.

b. Add App Server 2 in this inventory along with required variables that are needed to make it work.

c. The inventory hostname of the host should be the server name as per the wiki, for example stapp01 for app server 1 in Stratos DC.


Note: Validation will try to run the playbook using command ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml so please make sure the playbook works this way without passing any extra arguments.

### Solution:  
1. Go through the folder mentioned in the task and verified the playbook and files existing

`ls -l /home/thor/playbook/`
`cat  /home/thor/playbook/playbook.yml`
```
---

- hosts: all

  become: yes

  become_user: root

  tasks:

    - name: Install httpd package   

      yum:

        name: httpd

        state: installed

   

    - name: Start service httpd

      service:

        name: httpd

        state: started
```

2.  Create an inventory file and add the app server as per your task.


`vi /home/thor/playbook/inventory`

`cat /home/thor/playbook/inventory`
```
stapp02 ansible_host=172.16.238.11 ansible_ssh_pass=Am3ric@  ansible_user=steve
```

3.  Post file saved, run below command to execute the playbook 

`ansible-playbook  -i inventory playbook.yml`
