## Rolling Updates And Rolling Back Deployments with NodePort | POD Image Update in Kubernetes

### Question : 
There is a production deployment planned for next week. The Nautilus DevOps team wants to test the deployment update and rollback on Dev environment first so that they can identify the risks in advance. Below you can find more details about the plan they want to execute.

Create a namespace devops. Create a deployment called httpd-deploy under this new namespace, It should have one container called httpd, use httpd:2.4.28 image and 4 replicas. The deployment should use RollingUpdate strategy with maxSurge=1, and maxUnavailable=2. Also create a NodePort type service named httpd-service and expose the deployment on nodePort: 30008.


Now upgrade the deployment to version httpd:2.4.43 using a rolling update.


Finally, once all pods are updated undo the recent update and roll back to the previous/original version.

### Solution:  
1. At first  kubectl  utility configure and working from jump server, rub below commands

    `kubectl get namespace` 



2.  Create namespace as per the task request.

    `kubectl create namespace  devops`


3.  Create yaml  file with all the parameters 

```
cat > deploy.yaml <<EOF
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: httpd-deploy
  namespace: devops
spec:
  replicas: 4
  strategy:
    type: RollingUpdate
    rollingUpdate:
      maxSurge: 1
      maxUnavailable: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: httpd
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: httpd
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: httpd
          image: httpd:2.4.28
---                                                                                                           
apiVersion: v1                              
kind: Service                               
metadata:                                  
  name: httpd-service  
  namespace: devops  
spec:                                      
   type: NodePort                             
   selector:                                   
     app: httpd                        
   ports:                                      
     - port: 80                                 
       targetPort: 80                              
       nodePort: 30008
EOF
```

4.  Run below command to create pod

    `kubectl apply  -f  devops.yaml` 


5.  Wait for  pods to get running status
`kubectl get pods -n devops`

`kubectl get deployment -n devops`        

6.  Perform  rolling update by running below command

 `kubectl set image deployment httpd-deploy  httpd=httpd:2.4.43 --namespace devops --record=true`




7.  Rollback the deployment as per task  

`kubectl rollout undo deployment httpd-deploy  -n devops` 

8.  validate roll out status by command
