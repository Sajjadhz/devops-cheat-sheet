## Kubernetes Shared Volumes

### Question : 
We are working on an application that will be deployed on multiple containers within a pod on Kubernetes cluster. There is a requirement to share a volume among the containers to save some temporary data. The Nautilus DevOps team is developing a similar template to replicate the scenario. Below you can find more details about it.

Create a pod named volume-share-datacenter.

For first container, use image centos with latest tag only and remember to mention tag i.e centos:latest, container should be named as volume-container-datacenter-1, and run a command '/bin/bash', '-c' and 'sleep 10000'. Volume volume-share should be mounted at path /tmp/news.

For second container, use image centos with latest tag only and remember to mention tag i.e centos:latest, container should be named as volume-container-datacenter-2, and run a command '/bin/bash', '-c' and 'sleep 10000'. Volume volume-share should be mounted at path /tmp/cluster.


Volumes to be named as volume-share and use emptyDir: { }.

After creating pods, exec into the first container volume-container-datacenter-1, and create a file news.txt with content Welcome to xFusionCorp Industries! under the mount path of first container i.e /tmp/news.

The file news.txt should be present under the mounted path /tmp/cluster of second container volume-container-datacenter-2 as they are using shared volumes.

### Solution:  
1. At first  kubectl  utility configure and working from jump server, run below commands

`kubectl get services`

`kubectl get pods`

2.  Create yaml  file with all the parameters 

```
cat > /tmp/volume.yaml <<EOF
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: volume-share-datacenter
  labels:
    name: myapp
spec:
  volumes:
    - name: volume-share
      emptyDir: {}
  containers:
    - name: volume-container-datacenter-1
      image: centos:latest
      command: ["/bin/bash", "-c", "sleep 10000"]
      volumeMounts:
        - name: volume-share
          mountPath: /tmp/news
    - name: volume-container-datacenter-2
      image: centos:latest
      command: ["/bin/bash", "-c", "sleep 10000"]
      volumeMounts:
        - name: volume-share
          mountPath: /tmp/cluster
EOF
```

4.  Run below command to create pod

`kubectl create -f /tmp/volume.yaml`
