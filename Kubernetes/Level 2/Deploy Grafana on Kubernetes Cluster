## Deploy Grafana on Kubernetes Cluster

### Question : 
The Nautilus DevOps teams is planning to set up a Grafana tool to collect and analyze analytics from some applications. They are planning to deploy it on Kubernetes cluster. Below you can find more details.

1.) Create a deployment named grafana-deployment-nautilus using any grafana image for Grafana app. Set other parameters as per your choice.

2.) Create NodePort type service with nodePort 32000 to expose the app.

You need not to make any configuration changes inside the Grafana app once deployed, just make sure you are able to access the Grafana login page.

### Solution:  
1. Check existing running Pods  & Services 

`kubectl get pods`

`kubectl get services`

2.  Create a YAML  file with all the parameters,  Kindly do the changes as per task

```
cat > /tmp/grafana.yaml <<EOF
apiVersion: v1

kind: Service

metadata:

  name: grafana-service-nautilus

spec:

  type: NodePort

  selector:

    app: grafana

  ports:

    - port: 3000

      targetPort: 3000

      nodePort: 32000

---

apiVersion: apps/v1

kind: Deployment

metadata:

  name: grafana-deployment-nautilus

spec:

  selector:

    matchLabels:

      app: grafana

  template:

    metadata:

      labels:

        app: grafana

    spec:

      containers:

        - name: grafana-container-nautilus

          image: grafana/grafana:latest

          ports:

            - containerPort: 3000
EOF
```
3. Run the below command to create a pod 

`kubectl create -f /tmp/grafana.yaml`

4.  Wait for the pod to get completed status

`kubectl get service`

`kubectl get pods`

5.  Validate the task by open port view WUI
