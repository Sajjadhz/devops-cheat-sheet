## Rollback a Deployment in Kubernetes

### Question : 
This morning the Nautilus DevOps team rolled out a new release for one of the applications. Recently on of the customers logged a complaint which seems to be about a bug related to the recent release. Therefore, the team wants to roll back the recent release.

There is a deployment named nginx-deployment; roll it back to the previous revision.

Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host has been configured to work with the kubernetes cluster.

### Solution : 
1. At first  check existing deployment and pods running status     

`kubectl get deploy`

`kubectl get pods`

2. Run the below command to revert to an earlier release 

`kubectl rollout undo deployment  nginx-deployment`

3. Wait for deployment & pods to get running status
    
`kubectl get deploy`

`kubectl get pods`

`kubectl get deploy`

`kubectl get pods`

4. Validate the task by running the below command

`kubectl rollout status deployment  nginx-deployment`
