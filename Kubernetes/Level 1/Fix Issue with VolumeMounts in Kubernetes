## Fix Issue with VolumeMounts in Kubernetes

### Question :  
We deployed a Nginx and PHPFPM based setup on Kubernetes cluster last week and it had been working fine. This morning one of the team members made a change somewhere which caused some issues, and it stopped working. Please look into the issue and fix it:

The pod name is nginx-phpfpm and configmap name is nginx-config. Figure out the issue and fix the same.


Once issue is fixed, copy /home/thor/index.php file from jump host into nginx-container under nginx document root and you should be able to access the website using Website button on top bar.

### Solution:  
1. Check existing running pods 

`kubectl get pods`

2. check the shared volume path in existing config map 

`kubectl get configmap`

`kubectl describe configmap nginx-config`

3. Get the configuration in the YAML file from the running pod 

`kubectl get pod nginx-phpfpm -o yaml  > /tmp/nginx.yaml`

`ll /tmp/`

`cat /tmp/nginx.yaml`

4. Edit the nginx.yaml file and changed ‘/usr/share/nginx/html’ to ‘/var/www/html’ in 3 places.

`cat /tmp/nginx.yaml  |grep /usr/share/nginx/html`
```
    {"apiVersion":"v1","kind":"Pod","metadata":{"annotations":{},"labels":{"app":"php-app"},"name":"nginx-phpfpm","namespace":"default"},"spec":{"containers":[{"image":"php:7.2-fpm","name":"php-fpm-container","volumeMounts":[{"mountPath":"/var/www/html","name":"shared-files"}]},{"image":"nginx:latest","name":"nginx-container","volumeMounts":[{"mountPath":"/usr/share/nginx/html","name":"shared-files"},{"mountPath":"/etc/nginx/nginx.conf","name":"nginx-config-volume","subPath":"nginx.conf"}]}],"volumes":[{"emptyDir":{},"name":"shared-files"},{"configMap":{"name":"nginx-config"},"name":"nginx-config-volume"}]}}

            k:{"mountPath":"/usr/share/nginx/html"}:

- mountPath: /usr/share/nginx/html
```
5. Post changes the mount path run below command to replace the running pods   

`kubectl replace -f /tmp/nginx.yaml --force`

6.  Wait for pods to get running status.

`kubectl get pods`

7. Now copy the index.php file as per the task.  

`ll /home/thor/`

`kubectl cp  /home/thor/index.php  nginx-phpfpm:/var/www/html -c nginx-container`

8. validate the task by curl the Nginx port 

`kubectl exec -it nginx-phpfpm -c nginx-container  -- curl -I  http://localhost:8099`
