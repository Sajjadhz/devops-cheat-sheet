## Update an Existing Deployment in Kubernetes

### Question : 
There is an application deployed on Kubernetes cluster. Recently the Nautilus application development team developed a new version of the application that needs to be deployed now. As per new updates some new changes need to be made in this existing setup. So update the deployment and service as per details mentioned below:

We already have a deployment named nginx-deployment and service named nginx-service. Some changes need to be made in this deployment and service, make sure not to delete the deployment and service.


1.) Change the service nodeport from 30008 to 32165

2.) Change replicas count from 1 to 5

3.) Add a command: ["sh","-c","while true; do apt update; apt install -y vim php ; sleep 3; done"]

4.) Change the image from nginx:1.19 to nginx:latest

### Solution:  
1. At first  run below commands to check  the existing setup    

`kubectl get deploy`

`kubectl get service`

`kubectl get pods`

2. Edit the services as per the task and change the port no ( refer below video)     
`kubectl edit service nginx-service`

`kubectl get service`

3. Edit the deployment and do the changes as per the task  ( refer below video)
    
`kubectl edit deploy nginx-deployment`

`kubectl get deploy`

`kubectl get pods`

4.  Wait for  deployment & pods to get ready & running status
    
`kubectl get deploy`

`kubectl get pods`
