## Persistent Volumes in Kubernetes

### Question : 
We already created a directory /mnt/dba and a file index.html under the same on node01 (you need not to access node01), that location should be mounted within the container to web server's document root (keep in mind doc root can be different for Apache and Nginx web servers).

Create a PersistentVolume named as pv-nautilus. Configure the spec as storage class should be manual, set capacity to 7Gi, set access mode to ReadWriteOnce , volume type should be hostPath and set path to /mnt/dba.

Create a PersistentVolumeClaim named as pvc-nautilus. Configure the spec as storage class should be manual, set request storage to 4Gi, set access mode to ReadWriteOnce.

Create a pod named as pod-nautilus, set volume as storage-nautilus, and persistent volume claim to be named as pvc-nautilus. Container name should be container-nautilus, use image nginx with latest tag only and remember to mention tag i.e nginx:latest , container port should be default port 80, mount the volume to mount path to default doc root of web server and should be named storage-nautilus.
You can check your static website, exec into the pod and use curl command, i.e curl http://localhost.

Solution:  
1. At first  kubectl  utility configure and working from jump server, run below commands

    kubectl get services

    kubectl get pods


2.  Create yaml  file with all the parameters

```
cat > /tmp/pvc.yaml <<EOF
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: pv-nautilus
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 7Gi
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  storageClassName: manual
  hostPath:
    path: /mnt/dba
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: pvc-nautilus
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  storageClassName: manual
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 4Gi
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: pod-nautilus
spec:
  volumes:
    - name: storage-nautilus
      persistentVolumeClaim:
        claimName: pvc-nautilus
  containers:
    - name: container-nautilus
      image: nginx:latest
      ports:
        - containerPort: 80
      volumeMounts:
        - name: storage-nautilus
          mountPath:  /usr/share/nginx/html
EOF
```

3.  Run below command to create pod

    `kubectl create -f /tmp/pvc.yaml`



4.  Wait for  pods to get running status
        `kubectl get pods`



5.  Validate the task by running
