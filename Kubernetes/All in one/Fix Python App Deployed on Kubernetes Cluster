## Fix Python App Deployed on Kubernetes Cluster

### Question: 
One of the DevOps engineers was trying to deploy a python app on Kubernetes cluster. Unfortunately, due to some mis-configuration, the application is not coming up. Please take a look into it and fix the issues. Application should be accessible on the specified nodePort.

The deployment name is python-deployment-devops, its using poroko/flask-demo-appimage. The deployment and service of this app is already deployed.

nodePort should be 32345 and targetPort should be python flask app's default port.

### Solution:  
1. Check existing running deployment, pods & services

`kubectl get pods`

`kubectl get deploy`

`kubectl get svc`

2. Describe the configuration of the deployment

 `kubectl describe deploy`

`kubectl describe services python-service-xfusion`

3. Refer the logs to identify the  issues 

`kubectl logs python-deployment-xfusion-66fbc54cf5-q5bb8`
```
Error from server (BadRequest): container "python-container-xfusion" in pod "python-deployment-xfusion-66fbc54cf5-q5bb8" is waiting to start: trying and failing to pull image
```
