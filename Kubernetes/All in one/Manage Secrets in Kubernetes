## Manage Secrets in Kubernetes

### Question : 
The Nautilus DevOps team is working to deploy some tools in Kubernetes cluster. Some of the tools are licence based so that licence information needs to be stored securely within Kubernetes cluster. Therefore, the team wants to utilize Kubernetes secrets to store those secrets. Below you can find more details about the requirements:

We already have a secret key file beta.txt under /opt location on jump host. Create a secret named as beta and it should contain the password/license-number present in beta.txt file.

Also create a pod named secret-devops.

Configure pod's spec as container name should be secret-container-devops, image should be ubuntu preferably with latest tag (remember to mention the tag with image). Use command '/bin/bash', '-c' and 'sleep 10000' for container. Consume the created secret in a volume named secret-volume-devops . The mount path should be /opt/apps and mode should be readOnly.

To verify you can exec into the container secret-container-devops, to check the secret key under the mounted path /opt/apps.

Secret type should be generic.

Note: The kubectl utility on jump_host has been configured to work with the kubernetes cluster.

### Solution:  

1. At first create a secret named as beta as per the given path

`cat /opt/beta.txt`

`kubectl create secret generic beta --from-file=/opt/beta.txt`

`ll /opt`

2.  Create  a YAML  file with all the parameters
```
cat > secret.yml <<EOF

apiVersion: v1

kind: Pod

metadata:

  name: secret-devops

  labels:

    name: myapp

spec:

  volumes:

    - name: secret-volume-devops

      secret:

        secretName: beta

  containers:

    - name: secret-container-devops

      image: ubuntu:latest

      command: ["/bin/bash", "-c", "sleep 10000"]

      volumeMounts:

        - name: secret-volume-devops

          mountPath: /opt/apps

          readOnly: true
EOF
```
3. Run the below command to create a pod 


`create -f secret.yml`

4.  Wait for pods to get running status 

`kubectl get pods`

5.  Validate the task by running the below command 


`kubectl exec secret-devops -- cat /opt/apps/beta.txt`
