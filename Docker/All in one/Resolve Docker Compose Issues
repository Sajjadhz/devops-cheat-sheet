## Resolve Docker Compose Issues

### Question : 
The Nautilus DevOps team is working to deploy one of the applications on App Server 2 in Stratos DC. Due to a misconfiguration in the docker compose file, the deployment is failing. We would like you to take a look into it to identify and fix the issues. More details can be found below:

a. docker-compose.yml file is present on App Server 2 under /opt/docker directory.

b. Try to run the same and make sure it works fine.

c. Please do not change the container names being used. Also, do not update or alter any other valid config settings in the compose file or any other relevant data that can cause app failure.

### Solution:  


 1. At first login on app server as per the task & Switch to  root user 
 ```
sshpass -p Am3ric@ ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no steve@stapp02

sudo su -
```
2. check the existing file docker-compose.yml  under /opt/docker directory. File  has issue need to rectify  
`cat /opt/docker/docker-compose.yml`
```
version: '2'

services:

    web:

        image: .

        container_name: python

        port:

            - "5000:5000"

        volumes:

            - .:/code

        depends_on:

            - redis

    redis_app:

        image: redis

        container_name: redis

```
3. Edit the compose file and rectify  the changes 


`cd /opt/docker/`
`vi docker-compose.yml`

`cat docker-compose.yml`
```
version: '2'

services:

    web:

        build: .

        container_name: python

        ports:

            - "5000:5000"

        volumes:

            - .:/code

        depends_on:

            - redis_app

    redis_app:

        image: redis

        container_name: redis
```

4. Post file changes save and run to build

`docker-compose up`

5. Open new terminal  check existing docker container running

`docker ps`

6.  Validate the task by curl the port  

`curl -ik http://localhost:5000`
