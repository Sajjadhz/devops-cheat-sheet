## Docker Volumes Mapping

### Question : 
The Nautilus DevOps team is testing applications containerization, which issupposed to be migrated on docker container-based environments soon. In today's stand-up meeting one of the team members has been assigned a task to create and test a docker container with certain requirements. Below are more details:

a. On App Server 3 in Stratos DC pull ubuntu image (preferably latest tag but others should work too).

b. Create a new container with name media from the image you just pulled.

c. Map the host volume /opt/dba with container volume /var. There is an sample.txt file present on same server under /tmp; copy that file to /opt/dba. Also please keep the container in running state.

### Solution:  


 1. At first login on app server  &  Switch to the root user 
 ```
sshpass -p BigGr33n ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no banner@stapp03

sudo su -
```

2. Run the Below command to check existing docker images 

`docker images`

 3. Run the Below command to  pull the docker image on the server
        
`docker pull ubuntu:latest`

4. copy file /tmp/sample.txt  to /opt dba

`cp  /tmp/sample.txt  /opt/dba`

5. Run docker container from the image with given name and path    

`docker run --name media  -v /opt/dba:/var -d -it  ubuntu:latest`

6. Validate the task by login on  docker container and list  /var  

`docker ps`
`docker exec -it 00aebc3928e3  /bin/bash`
`ll /var`
