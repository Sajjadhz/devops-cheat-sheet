## Save Load and Transfer Docker Image

### Question : 
One of the DevOps team members was working on to create a new custom docker image on App Server 1 in Stratos DC. He is done with his changes and image is saved on same server with name games:devops. Recently a requirement has been raised by a team to use that image for testing, but the team wants to test the same on App Server 3. So we need to provide them that image on App Server 3 in Stratos DC.

a. On App Server 1 save the image games:devops in an archive.

b. Transfer the image archive to App Server 3.

c. Load that image archive on App Server 3 with same name and tag which was used on App Server 1.

Note: Docker is already installed on both servers; however, if its service is down please make sure to start it.

### Solution:  
1. Login on   App server as per the task

```
sshpass -p Ir0nM@n ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no tony@stapp01

sudo su -
```

2. List the existing images in docker which need to archive

`docker images`

3. save the image games:devops in an archive 

`docker save -o /tmp/games.tar games:devops`

`ll /tmp/`
4. Copy the tar file on Stapp03 app server 

`scp /tmp/games.tar banner@stapp03:/tmp`
5. Login on  Stapp03 app server & switch to root user
```
sshpass -p BigGr33n ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no banner@stapp03

sudo su -
```
6. Go to tmp folder and confirm the tar file copied successfully 
`ll /tmp/`

7. Start Docker service if its not active
`systemctl start docker`
`systemctl status docker`
8. Load that image archive 
`docker load -i games.tar`
9. Validate the task by docker images
`docker images`
