## Linux Banner KodeKloud Engineer Task

###  Question :  
During the monthly compliance meeting, it was pointed out that several servers in the Stratos DC do not have a valid banner. The security team has provided serveral approved templates which should be applied to the servers to maintain compliance. These will be displayed to the user upon a successful login.


Update the message of the day on all application and db servers for Nautilus. Make use of the approved template located at /tmp/nautilus_banner on jump host

### Solution:  
1.  Copy the /tmp/nautilus_banner using scp command from jumpserver to  

all Apps & DB servers.

`ll /tmp/nautilus_banner`

`scp -r  /tmp/nautilus_banner  tony@stapp01:/tmp`

2. Login to all the App server  & switch to root user 

    Now move copied file banner  /tmp to /etc/motd 
```
sshpass -p Ir0nM@n ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no tony@stapp01

sudo su -

mv /tmp/nautilus_banner  /etc/motd
```

3. Validate the open new terminal and login with user 
`ssh tony@stapp01`
