## DNS Troubleshooting Linux Server KodeKloud Engineer Task

### Question :  
The system admins team of xFusionCorp Industries has noticed intermittent issues with DNS resolution in several apps . App Server 3 in Stratos Datacenter is having some DNS resolution issues, so we want to add some additional DNS nameservers on this server.
As a temporary fix we have decided to go with Google public DNS (ipv4). Please make appropriate changes on this server.


### Solution:  
1. At first login to app server  & Switch to  root user 
```
sshpass -p BigGr33n ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no banner@stapp03

sudo su -
```

3.  Verify the existing  resolve.conf file  


`cat /etc/resolv.conf`
```
search stratos.xfusioncorp.com

nameserver 127.0.0.11

options ndots:0
```


4.  Edit the  resolv.conf  file and add public DNS 8.8.8.8 as per task.


`vi /etc/resolv.conf`
`cat /etc/resolv.conf`
```
search stratos.xfusioncorp.com

nameserver 127.0.0.11

nameserver 8.8.8.8

options ndots:0
```
