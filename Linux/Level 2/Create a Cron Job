## Create a Cron Job

### Question :  
The Nautilus system admins team has prepared scripts to automate several day-to-day tasks. They want them to be deployed on all app servers in Stratos DC on a set schedule. Before that they need to test similar functionality with a sample  cron job. Therefore, perform the steps below:

a. Install cronie package on all Nautilus app servers and start crond service.

b. Add a  cron */5 * * * * echo hello > /tmp/cron_text for root user.


### Solution:  
1. At first login to all App server  & Switch to  root user

```
sshpass -p Ir0nM@n ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no tony@stapp01

sudo su -
```

2. Install cronie package on server 


`yum install cronie -y`

3.  Start  cron service & check the  status 

`systemctl start crond.service`

`systemctl status crond.service`

4.  Create a cronjob  as per the task for root user

`crontab -e`
```
no crontab for root - using an empty one

crontab: installing new crontab
```
 
5.  Check  cron job for user root

`crontab -l`
```
*/5 * * * * echo hello > /tmp/cron_text
```


6.  Validate  cron_text file is created successfully, before that done finish the task


`ll /tmp/`
```
total 8

-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   6 Jun 23 09:55 cron_text

-rwx------ 1 root root 836 Aug  1  2019 ks-script-rnBCJB

-rw------- 1 root root   0 Aug  1  2019 yum.log
