## Linux Postfix Troubleshooting

### Question : 
Some users of the monitoring app have reported issues with xFusionCorp Industries mail server. They have a mail server in Stork DC where they are using postfix mail transfer agent. Postfix service seems to fail. Try to identify the root cause and fix it.

Please Note :-  Perform the below commands based on your question  server,  user name & other details might differ . So please read task carefully before executing. All the Best üëç

### Solution:  
1. Login on   Mail  server as per the task and switch root user
```
sshpass -p Gr00T123 ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no groot@stmail01

sudo su -
```
2. Start postfix service , check status with -l for details error output 
```
systemctl start postfix

systemctl status postfix -l
```
3. As we identify the issue in configuration file edit and do the changes

`cat /etc/postfix/main.cf |grep inet_interface`
`vi /etc/postfix/main.cf`

`cat /etc/postfix/main.cf |grep inet_interface`
```
# The inet_interfaces parameter specifies the network interface

inet_interfaces = all

#inet_interfaces = $myhostname

#inet_interfaces = $myhostname, localhost

#inet_interfaces = localhost

# the address list specified with the inet_interfaces parameter.

# receives mail on (see the inet_interfaces parameter).

# to $mydestination, $inet_interfaces or $proxy_interfaces.

# - destinations that match $inet_interfaces or $proxy_interfaces,

# unknown@[$inet_interfaces] or unknown@[$proxy_interfaces] is returned
```
4. Post configuration saved start the services and check the status 
```
systemctl start postfix

systemctl status postfix
```
5. validate the task by telnet the port 25 

`telnet stmail01 25`
