## Configure Local Yum repos

### Question :  
The Nautilus production support team and security team had a meeting last month in which they decided to use local yum repositories for maintaing packages needed for their servers. For now they have decided to configure a local yum repo on Nautilus Backup Server. This is one of the pending items from last month, so please configure a local yum repository on Nautilus Backup Server as per details given below.

a. We have some packages already present at location /packages/downloaded_rpms/ on Nautilus Backup Server.

b. Create a yum repo named local_yum and make sure to set Repository ID to local_yum. Configure it to use package's location /packages/downloaded_rpms/.

c. Install package httpd from this newly created repo.

### Solution:  

1. At first login on Backup server  & Switch to  root user

```
sshpass -p H@wk3y3 ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no clint@stbkp01

sudo su -
```

2. Run the Below command to   check is there  already any yum repository is available     

`yum repolist`   
```
Loaded plugins: fastestmirror, ovl

Determining fastest mirrors

repolist: 0
```


3. Since there is no repo you need to create local repo  as per the task

`vi /etc/yum.repos.d/local_yum.repo`

`cat /etc/yum.repos.d/local_yum.repo`

[local_yum]
```
name=local_yum

baseurl=file:///packages/downloaded_rpms/

enabled = 1

gpgcheck = 0
```

4. After the file is saved, check to create repo listed 

`yum repolist`
```
Loaded plugins: fastestmirror, ovl

local_yum                                                                                                           | 2.9 kB  00:00:00    

local_yum/primary_db                                                                                                |  57 kB  00:00:00    

repo id                                                           repo name                                                          status

local_yum                                                         local_yum                                                          55

repolist: 55
```

5. As per the task install package  (I have installed httpd using this repo )

`yum install httpd`

6. Validate the task 

[root@stbkp01 yum.repos.d]# `yum list httpd`
```
