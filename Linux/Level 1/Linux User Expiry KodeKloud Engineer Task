## Linux User Expiry KodeKloud Engineer Task

### Question :  
A developer mark has been assigned Nautilus project temporarily as a backup resource. As a temporary resource for this project, we need a temporary user for mark. Itâ€™s a good idea to create a user with a set expiration date so that the user won't be able to access servers beyond that point.

Therefore, create a user named mark on the App Server 1. Set expiry date to 2021-04-15 in Stratos Datacenter. Make sure the user is created as per standard and is in lowercase.

### Solution:  
1. At first login on App server   &  Switch to  root user 

```
sshpass -p Ir0nM@n ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no tony@stapp01

sudo su -
```

2.  1st check user is existed on the server  by below command     

`id  mark`
```
id: mark: no such user
```

3.  If user not found the then you create a user  as per given in your task     

`adduser mark`

`id  mark`
```
uid=1002(mark) gid=1002(mark) groups=1002(mark)
```

4.  Validate user is created successfully  with default expiry date 
   
`chage -l mark`
```
Last password change                                    : Jun 26, 2021

Password expires                                        : never

Password inactive                                       : never

Account expires                                         : never

Minimum number of days between password change          : 0

Maximum number of days between password change          : 99999

Number of days of warning before password expires       : 7
```

5. Run below command to change the default expires to date as per your task

`chage -E 2021-04-15 mark`

6. Validate changes are implemented  successfully as per the task request.

`chage -l mark`
```
