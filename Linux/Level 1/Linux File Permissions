## Linux File Permissions

### Question : 
There are new requirements to automate a backup process that was performed manually by the xFusionCorp Industries system admins team earlier. To automate this task, the team has developed a new bash script xfusioncorp.sh. They have already copied the script on all required servers, however they did not make it executable on one the app server i.e App Server 1 in Stratos Datacenter.

Please give executable permissions to /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh script on App Server 1. Also make sure every user can execute it.

### Solution:  
1. Login on   App server as per the task
```
sshpass -p Ir0nM@n ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no tony@stapp01

sudo su -
```
2. List the file existing file permission     

`ls -ltr /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh`
3. As per the task all other users need to have execute permission   

`chmod o+rx /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh`
```
cat /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh

#!/bin/bash

echo "Welcome To KodeKloud"
```
4. Verify the file permissions and execute the script form user 
```
ls -lrt /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh

-------r-x 1 root root 40 Jun 17 09:25 /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh 

exit

logout

sh /tmp/xfusioncorp.sh

Welcome To KodeKloud
```
