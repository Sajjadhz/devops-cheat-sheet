```

Note :- As per the task, BSD.txt file should be intact. But using "sed -i" will change the file in place.So if you want to use "sed -i" , make the copy of the BSD.txt to respective files and do the changes on newly created files.

Another option is which task required is just apply "sed" on original file and redirect the output to respective files. This won't affect the original place. As show below

3. Delete all lines containing word software and save results in /home/BSD_DELETE.txt file

```
sed '/\<software\>/d' /home/BSD.txt > /home/BSD_DELETE.txt

cat /home/BSD_DELETE.txt |grep software
```


 

4.  Cat the output for the word which going to replace 

```
cat /home/BSD.txt |grep and
