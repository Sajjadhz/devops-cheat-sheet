## Install and Configure PHP-FPM

### Question: 
The Nautilus application development team is planning to launch a new PHP-based application, which they want to deploy on Nautilus infra in Stratos DC. The development team had a meeting with the production support team and they have shared some requirements regarding the infrastructure. Below are the requirements they shared:

a. Install nginx on app server 1 , configure it to use port 8098 and its document root should be /var/www/html.

b. Install php-fpm version 7.3 on app server 1, it should listen on port 9000.

c. Configure php-fpm and nginx to work together.

d. There is an index.php file on jump host at location /tmp that needs to be copied under the document root on the nginx server.

e. Once configured correctly you can access the website usng APP button on the top bar.

### Solution:  
1. Login on App server as per the task & switch to root user
```
sshpass -p Ir0nM@n ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no tony@stapp01

sudo su -
```

2. To install Nginx we need to install epel repo first 

`yum install epel-release`

3. Now Install Nginx 

`yum install nginx`

4. For installing php-fpm install the php repo


`yum install http://rpms.remirepo.net/enterprise/remi-release-7.rpm`

5. Disable the default PHP-fpm version repo 

`yum-config-manager --disable remi-php54`

6. Make sure you Enable PHP-fpm version repo as per the task 
`yum-config-manager --enable remi-php73`

7. Edit the Nginx configuration 

`vi /etc/nginx/nginx.conf`                                       

`cat /etc/nginx/nginx.conf`                                                                                           
```
server {                                                                          

        listen       8098;                                                           

        listen       [::]:8098;                                                      

        server_name  _;                                                               

        root         /var/www/html;                                

        # Load configuration files for the default server block.                     

        include /etc/nginx/default.d/*.conf;   

        location ~ \.php$ {                                                          

          try_files $uri = 404;                                                      

          include fastcgi_params;                                                     

          fastcgi_pass  127.0.0.1:9000;                                              

          fastcgi_index index.php;                                      

          fastcgi_param  SCRIPT_FILENAME  $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;        

         }                                                                           

        location /                                                                    

        {                                                                            

        index  index.php index.html index.htm;                                       

        }                                                                          

        error_page 404 /404.html;
