## Create a Linux User with non-interactive shell

### Question :  
Create a Linux User with a non-interactive shell The System Admin Team of XfusionCorp Industries has installed a backup agent tool on all app servers. As per the tool's requirements, they need to create a user with a non-interactive shell. 

In this article, we'll discuss a way to create new user with non-interactive shell using the useradd command.

useradd may be a low level utility for adding users. On Debian, administrators should usually use adduser(8) instead.

Most of them task got fail because of there's no bin file exist in path /bin/nologin

For non interactive user you'll used 2 options below

/sbin/nologin is specifically designed to switch a shell and produces output complaining you cannot log-in.
where as /bin/false doesn't give output
-s, --shell SHELL
The name of a replacement user's login shell. this feature sets the SHELL variable in /etc/default/useradd.

### Solution:  
1. At first login to the respective mentioned server in the task. Mine is stapp02

```
sshpass -p Am3ric@ ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no steve@stapp02

sudo su -
```

2.  1st check user is existed on the server  by below command    

`id ravi`

3.  If the user is not found the then you create a user with a non-interactive shell    

`adduser ravi  -s /sbin/nologin`

4.  Validate user is created successfully as per the task request.      

`id ravi`
```
uid=1002(ravi) gid=1002(ravi) groups=1002(ravi)
```
`cat /etc/passwd |grep ravi`
```
ravi:x:1002:1002::/home/ravi:/sbin/nologin

```
