## Ansible Replace Module

### Question : 
There is data on all app servers in Stratos DC. The Nautilus development team shared some requirement with the DevOps team to alter some of the data as per recent changes. The DevOps team is working to prepare an Ansible playbook to accomplish the same. Below you can find more details about the task.

Create a playbook.yml under /home/thor/ansible on jump host; an inventory is already place under /home/thor/ansible on Jump host itself.

We have a file /opt/dba/blog.txt on app server 1. Using Ansible replace module replace string xFusionCorp to Nautilus in that file.

We have a file /opt/dba/story.txt on app server 2. Using Ansiblereplace module replace string Nautilus to KodeKloud in that file.

We have a file /opt/dba/media.txt on app server 3. Using Ansible replace module replace string KodeKloud to xFusionCorp Industries in that file.

### Solution:  
1. Go through the folder mentioned in task and verified the playbook     

`cd /home/thor/ansible`
`vi playbook.yml`

`cat playbook.yml`
```
- name: Ansible replace

  hosts: stapp01,stapp02,stapp03

  become: yes

  tasks:

    - name: blog.txt replacement

      replace:

        path: /opt/dba/blog.txt

        regexp: "xFusionCorp"

        replace: "Nautilus"

      when: inventory_hostname == "stapp01"

    - name: story.txt replacement

      replace:

        path: /opt/dba/story.txt

        regexp: "Nautilus"

        replace: "KodeKloud"

      when: inventory_hostname == "stapp02"

    - name: media.txt replacement

      replace:

        path: /opt/dba/media.txt

        regexp: "KodeKloud"

        replace: "xFusionCorp Industries"

      when: inventory_hostname == "stapp03"



```
3.  Post file saved , run below command to execute the playbook


`ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml`

4.  Validate the task by login and cat the file

`ssh -t tony@stapp01 "cat /opt/dba/blog.txt"`
