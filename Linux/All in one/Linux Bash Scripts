## Linux Bash Scripts

### Question : 
The production support team of xFusionCorp Industries is working on developing some bash scripts to automate different day to day tasks. One is to create a bash script for taking websites backup. They have a static website running on App Server 2 in Stratos Datacenter, and they need to create a bash script named ecommerce_backup.sh which should accomplish the following tasks. (Also remember to place the script under /scripts directory on App Server 2)

a. Create a zip archive named xfusioncorp_ecommerce.zip of /var/www/html/ecommerce directory.

b. Save the archive in /backup/ on App Server 2. This is a temporary storage, as backups from this location will be clean on weekly basis. Therefore, we also need to save this backup archive on Nautilus Backup Server.

c. Copy the created archive to Nautilus Backup Server server in /backup/ location.

d. Please make sure script won't ask for password while copying the archive file. Additionally, the respective server user (for example, tony in case of App Server 1) must be able to run it.

### Solution : 
1. At first login to app as per your task
```
sshpass -p Am3ric@ ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no steve@stapp02

sudo su -
```

2. Then go to the scripts folder and create a backup script 

`vi /scripts/ecommerce_backup.sh`

`cat  /scripts/ecommerce_backup.sh`
```
#!/bin/bash

zip -r /backup/xfusioncorp_ecommerce.zip /var/www/html/ecommerce

scp /backup/xfusioncorp_ecommerce.zip clint@stbkp01:/backup
```

3. Then create a keygen and copy the key to the backup server so that the bash script will not require any password  

`ssh-keygen`

4. Copy the key on the backup server & cross-check login without password prompt

`ssh-copy-id clint@stbkp01`

`ssh clint@stbkp01`

`logout`

5.  Finally go to scripts folder and run the bash scripts by this command

`sh ecommerce_backup.sh`

6. Now you can check the backup folder for the zip file on both app02 and backup server. If you find the zip file then it should be done.

```
`ll /backup`

`ssh clint@stbkp01`

`ll /backup`

```
