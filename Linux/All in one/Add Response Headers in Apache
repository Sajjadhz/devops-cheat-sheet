## Add Response Headers in Apache

### Question: 
We are working on hardening Apache web server on all app servers. As a part of this process we want to add some of the Apache response headers for security purpose. We are testing the settings one by one on all app servers. As per details mentioned below enable these headers for Apache:

Install httpd package on App Server 3 using yum and configure it to run on 6100 port, make sure to start its service.

Create an index.html file under Apache's default document root i.e /var/www/html and add below given content in it.

Welcome to the xFusionCorp Industries!

Configure Apache to enable below mentioned headers:

X-XSS-Protection header with value 1; mode=block

X-Frame-Options header with value SAMEORIGIN

X-Content-Type-Options header with value nosniff

Note: You can test using curl on the given app server as LBR URL will not work for this task.

### Solution:  
1. Login on   App server as per the task & switch to root user
```
sshpass -p BigGr33n ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no banner@stapp03

sudo su -
```
2. Install httpd package on the server

`yum install httpd -y`

3. Edit the configuration  file change port as per the task & add Header at end


`vi / etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf` 

`cat /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf  |grep Listen`
```
# Listen: Allows you to bind Apache to specific IP addresses and/or

# Change this to Listen on specific IP addresses as shown below to

#Listen 12.34.56.78:80

Listen 6100
```

`cat /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf  |grep X`
```
Header set X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block"

Header always append X-Frame-Options SAMEORIGIN

Header set X-Content-Type-Options nosniff
```

4. Create Index file with given content in task

`ll /var/www/html/`

`vi /var/www/html/index.html`

`cat /var/www/html/index.html`

5. Start httpd & check the status 

`systemctl start httpd`

`systemctl status  httpd`

6. Validate the task by Curl

`curl http://localhost:8083`
```

`curl -i http://localhost:8083`
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
