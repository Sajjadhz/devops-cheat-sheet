## Linux Collaborative Directories

### Question : 
The Nautilus team doesn't want its data to be accessed by any of the other groups/teams due to security reasons and want their data to be strictly accessed by the devops group of the team.

Setup a collaborative directory /devops/data on Nautilus App 1 server in Stratos Datacenter.

The directory should be group owned by the group devops and the group should own the files inside the directory. The directory should be read/write/execute to the group owners, and others should not have any access.

### Solution:  
1. Login on   App server as per the task

```
sshpass -p Ir0nM@n ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no tony@stapp01

sudo su -
```

2. Create folder according to the task & list to confirm

`mkdir -p /devops/data`  

`ll -lsd /devops/data/`
```
4 drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Jun 19 04:54 /devops/data/
```
3. Change group of the directory from root to mentioned group in task

chgrp = changing primary group for the directory.

-R = recursive . changes will reflect all sub-directories and files below.

`chgrp -R devops /devops/data`

`ll -lsd /devops/data/`
```
4 drwxr-xr-x 2 root devops 4096 Jun 19 04:54 /devops/data/
```

4. Change group of the directory from root to mentioned group in task

chmod - modifying permission for sharedgrp.

2770  - Giving full permission to user (root) & group users and zero permmision for other users.

           2 - Special Permission. set group id.

           7 -  4+2+1 = 7 (4= read, 2 = write, 1 = execute).User (root) Permission

           7 -  4+2+1 = 7 (4= read, 2 = write, 1 = execute). Group Permission


           0 - Other users.(zero permission).


`chmod -R 2770 /devops/data`

`ll -lsd /devops/data/`
```
4 drwxrws--- 2 root devops 4096 Jun 19 04:54 /devops/data/
```
