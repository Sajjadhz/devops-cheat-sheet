## Using Ansible Conditionals Copy Files

### Question : 
The Nautilus DevOps team discussed how they can train different team members to use Ansible for different automation tasks. There are numerous ways to perform a particular task using Ansible, but we want to utilize each aspect Ansible offers. to the team wants to utilise Ansible's conditionals to perform the following task:

An inventory file is already placed under /home/thor/ansible on jump host, with all the Stratos DC app servers included.

Create a playbook /home/thor/ansible/playbook.yml and make sure to use Ansible's when conditionals statements to perform the following tasks.

Copy blog.txt file present under /usr/src/dba directory on jump host to App Server 1 under /opt/dba directory. Its user and group owner must be user tony and its permissions must be 0777 .

Copy story.txt file present under /usr/src/dba directory on jump host to App Server 2 under /opt/dba directory. Its user and group owner must be user steve and its permissions must be 0777 .

Copy media.txt file present under /usr/src/dba directory on jump host to App Server 3 under /opt/dba directory. Its user and group owner must be user banner and its permissions must be 0777 .

NOTE: You can use ansible_nodename variable from gathered facts with when condition. Additionally, please make sure you are running the play for all hosts i.e use - hosts: all.

Note: Validation will try to run playbook using command ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml, so please make sure playbook works this way, without passing any extra arguments.

### Solution:  
1. At first ansible inventory file is working properly and doesn't have any file exist from jump server to all the app server's      
```
cd /home/thor/ansible/

ll

total 8

-rw-r--r-- 1 thor thor  36 Jun 21 07:24 ansible.cfg

-rw-r--r-- 1 thor thor 237 Jun 21 07:24 inventory



ansible all -a "ls -ltr /opt/dba" -i inventory
```
2.  If you see above output then create playbook file
`vi playbook.yml`

```
- name: Copy text files to Appservers

  hosts: all

  become: yes

  tasks:

    - name: Copy blog.txt to stapp01

      ansible.builtin.copy:

        src: /usr/src/dba/blog.txt

        dest: /opt/dba/

        owner: tony

        group: tony

        mode: "0755"

      when: inventory_hostname == "stapp01"

    - name: Copy story.txt to stapp02

      ansible.builtin.copy:

        src: /usr/src/dba/story.txt

        dest: /opt/dba/

        owner: steve

        group: steve

        mode: "0755"

      when: inventory_hostname == "stapp02"

    - name: Copy media.txt to stapp03

      ansible.builtin.copy:

        src: /usr/src/dba/media.txt

        dest: /opt/dba/

        owner: banner

        group: banner

        mode: "0755"

      when: inventory_hostname == "stapp03"
```
3.  Post file saved , run below command to execute the playbook        

`ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml`

4.  Validate the task by below command 
`ansible all -a "ls -ltr /opt/dba" -i inventory`
