## Linux GPG Encryption

### Question : 
We have confidential data that needs to be transferred to a remote location, so we need to encrypt that data.We also need to decrypt data we received from a remote location in order to understand its content.

On storage server in Stratos Datacenter we have private and public keys stored /home/*_key.asc. Use those keys to perform the following actions.

Encrypt /home/encrypt_me.txt to /home/encrypted_me.asc.

Decrypt /home/decrypt_me.asc to /home/decrypted_me.txt. (Passphrase for decryption and encryption is kodekloud).

### Solution:  
1. Login on storage server & switch to root user
```sshpass -p Ir0nM@n ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no tony@stapp01

sudo su -
```
2.  All files located in /home 
`cd /home/`
3.  Import gpg Private & Public key 


`gpg --import public_key.asc`

`gpg --import private_key.asc`

4. Kindly verify keys are imported successfully

`gpg --list-keys`

`gpg --list-secret-keys`

5. Will encrypt the file txt in to asc in same folder path 


`gpg --encrypt -r kodekloud@kodekloud.com --armor < encrypt_me.txt  -o encrypted_me.asc`

6. Will decrypt the file asc in to txt  using passphrase within same folder path 


`gpg --decrypt decrypt_me.asc > decrypted_me.txt`

7. check the encrpyted & decrypted files  in  /home

`ls -l`

8.  Validate the task by cat the files output


```
cat decrypted_me.txt

cat decrypt_me.asc

cat encrypt_me.txt

cat encrypted_me.asc
```
