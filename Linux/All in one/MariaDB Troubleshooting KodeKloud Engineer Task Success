## MariaDB Troubleshooting KodeKloud Engineer Task Success

### Question :   
There is a critical issue going on with the Nautilus application in Stratos DC. The production support team identified that the application is unable to connect to the database. After digging into the issue, the team found that mariadb service is down on the database server.

Look into the issue and fix the same.

### Solution:  
1. At first login on database server  &  Switch to  root user 

```
sshpass -p Sp!dy ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no peter@stdb01

sudo su -
```

3. When you start the mariadb service you will get below error 

`systemctl status mariadb`
```
● mariadb.service - MariaDB database server

   Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/mariadb.service; disabled; vendor preset: disabled)

   Active: inactive (dead)
