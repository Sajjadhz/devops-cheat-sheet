### Solution:  
1. Login  to respective mentioned Backup server in task & switch to root

```
sshpass -p H@wk3y3 ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no clint@stbkp01

sudo su -
```

2.  1st check firewalld service status and existing rules for public zone


`firewall-cmd --zone=public --list-all`

3.  According to your task check the application port and add the below rule.
    
`firewall-cmd  --permanent --zone=public --add-port=6200/tcp`
```
success
```

4.  Reload the firewall rules & restart the firewall services.     

`firewall-cmd --reload`
