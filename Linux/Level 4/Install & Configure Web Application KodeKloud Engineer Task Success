## Install & Configure Web Application KodeKloud Engineer Task Success

### Question :  
xFusionCorp Industries is planning to host two static websites on their infra in Stratos Datacenter. The development of these websites is still in -progress, but we want to get the servers ready. The storage server has a shared directory /data that is mounted on each app host under /var/www/html directory. Please perform the following steps to accomplish the task:

a. Install httpd package and dependencies on all app hosts.

b. Apache should serve on port 8080 within the apps.

c. There are two website's backups /home/thor/news and /home/thor/cluster on jump_host. Set them up on Apache in a way that news should work on link http://<<lb-url>>/ecommerce/ and cluster should work on link http://<<lb-url>>/cluster. (do not worry about load balancer configuration, as its already configured).

d. You can access the website on LBR link; to do so click on the + button on top of your terminal, select the option Select port to view on Host 1, and after adding port 80 click on Display Port.



### Solution:  
1. At first login on app server  

```
sshpass -p Ir0nM@n ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no tony@stapp01

sudo su -
```

2. Run Below command to install openssh service for copying scp files    

`yum install  -y openssh-clients`

3. Restart ssh service

    `systemctl restart sshd`

4. Now copy the two websites folder  from Jumpserver to  app server     

`scp -r /home/thor/news tony@stapp01:/tmp`

`scp -r /home/thor/cluster tony@stapp01:/tmp`

6. Login back to app server (stapp01)  & install httpd     


`yum install  -y httpd`

7. Edit configuration file  `vi etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf` & 

change Listen port to 8080 


cat /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf |grep Listen
```
# Listen: Allows you to bind Apache to specific IP addresses and/or

# Change this to Listen on specific IP addresses as shown below to

#Listen 12.34.56.78:80

Listen 80

vi /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf

cat /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf |grep Listen

# Listen: Allows you to bind Apache to specific IP addresses and/or

# Change this to Listen on specific IP addresses as shown below to

#Listen 12.34.56.78:80

Listen 8080
```

8. Start & enable the httpd service below commands  

`systemctl enable httpd && systemctl start httpd && systemctl status  httpd`

9. Move  copied  folders  from tmp to /var/www/html folder


`mv /tmp/news/  /var/www/html/`

`mv /tmp/cluster/ /var/www/html/`

10.  Validate the task by below command from Jumpserver    

`curl http://stapp01:8080/news`

`curl http://stapp01:8080/cluster`
